# MessagingDB

This messaging database artifact was originally created in the class DAD-220: Intro to SQL. The database was created in the codio environment. The database includes a few different tables some of which are joined to share information. Including a person table, a contact table, a message table, and an image table. This was originally created in term 19EW3. I took this database and recreated it onto my local machine.

I selected this artifact because it also displays a variety of skills. It shows a command of essential SQL subsets, such as DDL (Data Definition Language), which are commands like create, alter, and delete. It also shows my ability to use the DML (Data Manipulation Language) subset. This uses commands such as insert, update, delete and retrieve data from the database. And finally, it displays skills in DCL (Data Control Language) involving granting and removing user permissions.

I did meet all the objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to fully recreate the databased. I do not have any update to my outcome coverage plan.

I really enjoyed working on this artifact. It was nice to go back and work with MySQL again, and it reinforced what I learned in that course. The main thing I learned working on this program was installing and working with the MYSQL Workbench. Through most of my time at SNHU, I have worked on a remote desktop or through some online environment. I have learned a lot by having to go back to these old projects and learn how to install and work the environments on my local machine.
